# somero_app_example
A very basic app used as an example in Somero2015 / GNU Social Camp

This is not an example of a correct app's architecture. Many things are this way for teaching reasons.

This little app is an example for the *GNU Social Camp* talk and workshop about Firefox OS and GNU Social.

Libraries used:

* gaia-fonts : Fira Sans font
* handlebars : Client side templates
* localforage : Local Storage in the browser
* crossroads : Routing librarie
* hasher  : Manage url hash (crossroads dependency)
* jquery  : DOM Manipulation
* bootstrap : Some CSS base
